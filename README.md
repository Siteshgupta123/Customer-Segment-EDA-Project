# Sales & Customer Analytics Dashboard
#### üìä Project Overview
**This project transforms a raw, unstructured sales dataset into a powerful and insightful business intelligence tool. The objective was to design a comprehensive dashboard that provides actionable insights into sales performance and customer behavior. The final dashboard, built in Power BI, serves as a single source of truth for key metrics, enabling a data-driven approach to strategic planning and decision-making.**

-------------------
## Key Metrics & Impact:

- **Total Revenue**: Identified over **$8.5 million** in total sales revenue.
- **Customer Base**: Analyzed data for over **4,000 unique customers**.
- **Transactions**: The analysis was performed on a dataset containing **363,119** sales transactions.
- **Top Product Performance**: Pinpointed the **top 10 products**, which accounted for a significant portion of total revenue, with the top product alone generating over **$168,000**.

## üí° Problem Solved & Business Objective:
**The Problem**: The business was operating with a raw, unstructured sales dataset of over **363,000** rows that contained data quality issues, inconsistent data types, and lacked calculated metrics. This made it impossible to get a clear picture of business health, track performance over time, or understand customer dynamics.

### The Objective:
- **Data Quality**: Clean and prepare the raw data for reliable analysis.
- **KPI Development**: Create key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics from the ground up to measure success.
- **Dashboard Design**: Build a dynamic, two-page dashboard in Power BI that is easy to navigate and understand.
- **Actionable Insights**: Deliver clear, actionable insights to help stakeholders make informed decisions on sales, marketing, and customer strategy.
------------------------
## üõ†Ô∏è Data Engineering & Transformation
A rigorous data cleaning and transformation process was undertaken to ensure accuracy and prepare the data for visualization.
- **Data Cleaning**: The redundant Unnamed: 0 index column was identified and removed.
- **Data Type Correction**: The InvoiceDate column was converted from a text format to a datetime data type for time-series analysis. The CustomerID column was correctly formatted from a float to an integer.
- **Calculated Metrics**: New columns and measures were created using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to enrich the data and provide deeper insights:
  - **Average Order Value (AOV)**: Calculated as total sales divided by the number of unique orders.
  - **Sales Growth Rate %**: A critical measure for tracking month-over-month business momentum.
  - **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: A forward-looking metric that estimates the total value a customer will bring to the business over time.
  - **Descriptive Customer Segments**: The existing numerical segments (e.g., 0, 1, 2) were mapped to business-friendly names like "Champions," "At-Risk," and "Lost Customers" to enable targeted marketing.

## Dashboard Features
### Navigation
The dashboard is designed with two distinct pages:
- **Sales Performance Overview**: A landing page with high-level KPIs and trends.
- **Customer & Product Deep Dive**: A secondary page for in-depth analysis.
This is supported by clear navigation buttons that allow users to move between the pages easily.

### Dynamic Slicers
Slicers are included to allow users to filter data and customize their views.
- **Date Slicer**: Filter all visuals by Year, Quarter, and Month using a hierarchical dropdown.
- **Country & Product Slicers**: Allow users to focus on sales performance in a specific country or for a particular product.
- **Segment Slicer**: Filter the dashboard by customer segments (e.g., "Champions," "At-Risk").

### User-Friendly Controls
- **Reset Button**: A dedicated "Clear All Filters" button is included to reset the dashboard to its original state, ensuring accurate reporting and a smooth user experience.
- **Interactive Tooltips**: Users can hover over any visual to see additional details without cluttering the screen. This adds another layer of depth to the data.

## üìä Dashboard Visualizations & Insights
The final dashboard is a two-page report designed for a comprehensive analytical experience.
